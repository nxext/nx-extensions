# Getting Started

At this current moment we don't have an out of the back workspace setup. In order to use nxext/angular you need to create a new NX workspace.

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace --preset=empty
```

After creating the blank workspace. Run the following commands

```bash
npm install @nxext/angular --save
```
