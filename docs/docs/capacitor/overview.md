[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs) is a cross-platform native runtime for web applications developed by [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/).

While Ionic apps generate a Capacitor project by default, Capacitor is framework agnostic and should work with any application generated in an Nx workspace.

"Capacitor provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web standards as possible, while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them. Adding native functionality is easy with a simple Plugin API for Swift on iOS, Java on Android, and JavaScript for the web.

Capacitor is a spiritual successor to Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap, with inspiration from other popular cross-platform tools like React Native and Turbolinks, but focused entirely on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Capacitor is backward-compatible with many existing Cordova plugins."
