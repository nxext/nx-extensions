[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components) is a collection of high-quality components for developing cross-platform applications. When paired with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs), developers can make high-quality cross-platform applications with web technology.

The goal of `@nxext/ionic-react` is to enabled developers to create and maintain cross-platform applications in an Nx monorepo with Ionic and React. The ability to develop cross-platform applications from a single codebase along with a monorepo that enables easy and effective sharing can be a powerful combination.

Updates to `@nxext/ionic-react` will include migrations that will update the dependencies included with this plugin, as well as any code migrations if possible.
